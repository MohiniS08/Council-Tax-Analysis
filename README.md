# Council-Tax-Analysis
UK Local Authorities

# Project Overview 
This project explores **Council Tax performance in UK Local Authorities** using a workflow of:  
- **SQL** for querying and calculating KPIs  
- **Power BI** for dashboarding and visualization

 # Dataset  
As open datasets were incomplete, a **Realistic Mock Dataset** was created to simulate council tax reporting across multiple years.  

**Fields included:**  
- Year
- Region
- Local_Authority
- Amount_Collected_MillionGBP  
- Requirement_MillionGBP  
- Avg_BandD_GBP

CSV FILE: Council_Dataset.csv

# SQL Analysis
1. Collection Rate per Authority per Year
2. Total Collection & Average Band D by Year
3. Top 5 Authorities by Collection Rate
4. Regional Average Collection Rate
5. Collection Gap (Requirement – Collected)
6. Correlation Between Avg Band D and Collection Rate
